# üí´ About Me:
As a fifth-year Computer Science and Physics Major at The University of British Columbia, I am deeply passionate about leveraging code to address both the significant and the nuanced challenges we face in life. I thrive on creating and implementing software solutions that make a tangible difference.<br><br>

## üå± I‚Äôm currently learning more about 
- How I can use machine learning and NLP to create images. <br> 
- Working with the APIs of apps that I regularly use to create solutions for problems I encounter.  <be>


## ‚ö° What I am Working On
- A project mixing NLP and Machine Learning, focusing on generative models like DALL-E and computer vision to create my own AI. 
- Right now, I'm diving into a fun project: building an Apple Watch app that'll sync up with SmartLife. The goal? To get all my smart home gadgets under control straight from my wrist. I started cooking this up because honestly, it's something I've been wanting for my own use. Plus, I'm eager to explore how I can use the watch's dial for various functions, making the interaction even cooler and more intuitive.
